            <p><font size="5">In a total solar eclipse, the Moon passes in front of sun, blocking it completely for a few minutes, and darkness falls. A partial eclipse is when the Moon passes in front of the Sun but covers only part of it.</p>
            <p><b>There are three main types of solar eclipses:</b>
                <p><b>Total solar eclipse:</b> A total solar eclipse is visible from a small area on Earth.</p>
                <p><b>Partial solar eclipse:</b> This happens when the Sun, Moon and Earth are not exactly aligned.</p>
                <p><b>Annular solar eclipse:</b> An annular eclipse happens when the Moon is farthest from Earth.</p>

                <p><b><h2>Day And night</h2></b></p>
                <p>you May find the view of Earth from space surprising. In this photograph, there is a line dividing the part of the the world where it is night. As the Earth spins, the people in th dark move into the light, and those in th light move into the dark. the Moon is in the the foreground. It is also in half-shadow, and it too has daytime and night-time. One 'Moon day' lasts more than 20 'Earth day'. </p>

             <p><b><h2>Our Changing Moon</h2></b></p>
             <p>As the Moon moves around the Earth, different amounts of its lit half are visible to us. The different views of the half lit Moon that we get during its path around us are the Moon's phases.</p>
             <p>you can see how this works in the diagram (given below)</p>

             <p><b><h2>Moon Shapes</h2></b></p>
             <p>When people are asked to draw a picture of the Moon, they most often draw it as a crescent Shapes. But the crescent is just one of the Moon at all because the sun lights it up. Just like the Earth, only half of the Moon is lit up. As the Moon moves around the Earth, we see different amounts of the lit half. At one point of the Moon's orbit we can see none of its lit side. This is called new moon. At a different point of the orbit we can see the whole of the lit side. This is full moon. In between are the other phases of the Moon.</p>
